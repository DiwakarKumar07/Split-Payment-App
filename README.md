## Deployment (Docker)

### Build and Run with Docker

```sh
# Build the Docker image
# (Run this from the project root)
docker build -t split-payment-app .

# Run the container (default port 5000)
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file split-payment/.env split-payment-app
```

- Make sure your `.env` file is set up and accessible to Docker (see example above).
- The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Deploying to Render or Railway
- Create a new web service and connect your GitHub repo.
- Set environment variables in the platform dashboard (do not commit secrets).
- Use the Dockerfile for deployment, or let the platform auto-detect Node.js if preferred.
- For MongoDB, use a managed database service and update your `mongodb://localhost:27017/splitpayment`.
